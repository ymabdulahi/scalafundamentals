      - Method Chaining Basics: The method returns this or a new instance of the class, allowing the next method to be called on it.
      - Benefits: It makes code more readable and concise by eliminating the need for temporary variables and multiple statements.
      - Applicability: Method chaining can be used in any object-oriented programming language that allows methods to return objects.
