  Explanation:

  when the number 5 is passed in it does not satisfy the base condition of if (n <= 1) which means the expression n * factorial(n - 1)
  would be computed -> 5 * factorial(5-1). This call is recursive so will keep going until the base case is satisfied.

  When the number is very large it may cause this function to experience an error called stack overflow which is where the stored numbers overflow the memory stack.
  This happens because when a function is called in this way the JVM has to keep note of the state of each n to be able to compute the n * part of the expression
  n * factorial(n-1) which means the stack grows as the number increases.

  The reason why we see all the computing print statements first before the computed is because when the base case is hit then unwinding process begins and Stacks have a LIFO structure

  so it looks like this for a factorial(5) ==> 5 * factorial(5-1) -> 5 * factorial( 4 * factorial ( 3 * factorial (2 * factorial(1))))

  Tail recursion counters this as the recursive function is the last operation in the call which means the JVM does not need to retain states (value of n) and can instead pass in new
  values into the function reusing the stack.

    else recursiveHelper(n - 1, n * accumulator)

  def tailRecFactorial(n: Int) :Int ={
    @tailrec
    def recursiveHelper(t: Int, accumulator: Int): Int = {

  }

  /*
  Explanation:

  factorial(5) here looks like this -> factorial(5,1)
                                    => factorial(4, 5 * 1)
                                    => factorial(3, 4 * 5 * 1)
                                    => factorial(2, 3 * 4 * 5 * 1)
                                    => factorial(1, 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 1)

  The contrast here is that the factorial function is the last operation to be called to the JVM can just pass the new n
  into the function again and replace the previous one completely meaning the stack doesnt grow as it did using stack recursion, essentially turning into an iteration.

  The benefits to this method is that there is:
    - reduced risks in stack overflows for very deep recursions
    - no unwinding after the reaching the base case
    - stack can be reused with new parameters and previous states does not need to be retained. Meaning no need to grow stack
    - Resulting in improvements in both space and time complexity ( space : Stack doesnt grow, time: no unwinding process in the end as recursive call is final operation)
